### Glossary

- Dimensionality: dimensionality refers to the number of dimensions or independent variables in a system or dataset. It can be used in various fields such as mathematics, physics, and computer science to describe the number of parameters needed to fully describe or represent a system or dataset. For example, a two-dimensional dataset would require two variables (such as x and y coordinates) to plot or visualize the data, while a three-dimensional dataset would require three variables (such as x, y, and z coordinates) to plot or visualize the data in 3D space.

- Latent Space: a high-dimensional space that encodes a meaningful internal representation of observed events, such as images. This space is constructed by latent variables that capture essential features of the data, allowing for a more efficient and interpretable representation. Samples that are similar in the external world are positioned close to each other in this space, enabling efficient generalization and reducing noise and redundancy.

- Sparsity: sparsity refers to the property of having a small number of active (non-zero) elements in a given set or representation. In ML sparsity can refer to the number of activated filters in the network in response to input data.

- Image Feature Space: a latent space that captures high-level features of images, such as edges, shapes and colors. It is often used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images, where similar images are positioned closer to each other in the space based on their shared features.

- Disentanglement: refers to the ability of a machine learning model to identify and separate underlying factors of variation in the data, such as different features or causes, in an unsupervised way.

- Whitening: a linear transformation that transforms the covariance matrix of random input vectors to be the identity matrix.[1]  

- Normalization: a technique used in deep learning to standardize input data to improve model training and performance. The process involves rescaling the features to a similar scale, often to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. 

- Standarization: is the process of transforming data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, allowing for fair comparison between variables with different units of measurement.

- Regularization: is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

- Batch Normalization layer: is a module in a neural network that helps to normalize the inputs by adjusting and scaling the values before they are passed to the activation function. Is a technique in deep learning that normalizes the output of a previous layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. 

- Concept Whitening layer: is a module inserted in a neural network that helps constraining the latent space to represent target concepts and also provides a straightforward means to extract them. 

- Deep Residual Learning: residual learning is a technique used to improve the training of deep neural networks by adding shortcut connections that allow information to be passed through the network without going through every layer.

- PCA (Principal Component Analysis): it is a dimensionality reduction technique used to identify patterns in data and to represent it in a more concise form. The basic idea is to reduce the number of variables (features) in the dataset while retaining as much information as possible.

- Features (variables): a feature is an input variable used in a machine learning model to make a prediction. A feature can be any measurable characteristic or property of the data that is relevant to the task at hand.

- Feature Engineering: is the process of selecting, transforming, and scaling the input data to create features that are optimal for the task at hand.

- Encoding: encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. This is often necessary when working with data that needs to be stored or transmitted in a way that can be interpreted by different systems or applications.

- Embeddings: embeddings are a way of representing words, phrases, or other types of data as vectors of numerical values.

--------------------
## LITERATURE DRAFT CONCEPTS:

The best explanation of a simple model is the model itself; it perfectly represents itself and is easy to understand.

**Feature(Pixel):**
For example, in an image recognition task, features could be pixel values, color histograms, or other properties of the image that are relevant to identifying the object or scene depicted in the image. In a natural language processing task, features could be word counts, word embeddings, or other linguistic properties of the text that are relevant to the task, such as sentiment analysis or part-of-speech tagging.

The choice of features is critical to the performance of a machine learning model. The right set of features can greatly improve the accuracy of the model, while a poor choice of features can lead to poor performance. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, and scaling the input data to create features that are optimal for the task at hand.

**Dimensionality**
Dimensionality is a concept that refers to the number of features or variables used to represent a dataset or a problem. The dimensionality of a dataset can have a significant impact on the complexity and performance of machine learning algorithms. When the number of features is high relative to the number of observations, the dataset is said to have a high-dimensional feature space, and problems such as overfitting, curse of dimensionality, and sparsity can arise.

In the context of deep learning, dimensionality is also used to describe the number of input and output units in a neural network. The dimensionality of the input layer is determined by the number of features in the input data, while the dimensionality of the output layer is determined by the number of classes or regression targets in the problem. The dimensionality of the hidden layers, on the other hand, is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted to control the capacity and complexity of the network.

**Feature Engineering:**
Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming raw data into features that can be used as inputs for machine learning models. It involves cleaning, selecting, transforming, creating, and validating features to improve model performance. This is done by identifying relevant information in the data, representing it in a way kkkthe model can learn from, and evaluating the quality of the features. Feature engineering is critical for successful machine learning projects.
The process of feature engineering involves several steps:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: The first step is to clean and preprocess the raw data to remove any noise, missing values, or outliers that might affect the quality of the features.

Feature selection: This step involves selecting the most relevant features from the preprocessed data that are most likely to improve the model's performance. It can be done through various techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, principal component analysis (PCA), or feature importance ranking.

Feature transformation: Once the relevant features have been selected, they need to be transformed into a format that the model can use. This could involve normalization, scaling, binning, or encoding categorical variables.

Feature creation: Sometimes, new features can be created by combining existing features or by extracting additional information from the data. This could involve creating interaction terms, polynomial features, or aggregating data at different levels of granularity.

Feature validation: Finally, the quality of the features needs to be evaluated to ensure that they are informative, non-redundant, and do not overfit the data. This can be done through various techniques like cross-validation, hypothesis testing, or model performance evaluation.

**Disentanglement**
Disentanglement refers to the ability of a model to separate different factors of variation in the data, such as different features or causes, in an unsupervised way. This means that the model can identify and represent each factor independently, without mixing them up or relying on external guidance. Disentanglement is important because it can lead to better understanding, interpretability, and control of the learned representations, as well as better generalization and transferability to new tasks or domains. Disentanglement can be achieved by various methods, such as through careful design of the model architecture, training objectives, regularization techniques, or evaluation metrics, depending on the specific application and domain.

**Regularization**
Regularization is a common technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data. Regularization is achieved by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which reduces the complexity of the model by imposing constraints on the model parameters. The penalty term can take different forms, such as L1 or L2 regularization, which respectively encourage sparsity or small weights in the model. Regularization is an important tool for improving the generalization performance of machine learning models, especially when the number of features is large compared to the number of samples.

**Normalization**
In the context of neural networks, normalization can refer to different techniques, including batch normalization, layer normalization, and instance normalization. These techniques aim to alleviate the internal covariate shift problem and accelerate training by improving the conditioning of the optimization problem [5].

**PCA:** 
PCA works by identifying the underlying structure in the data by finding new variables, called principal components, that are linear combinations of the original variables. These principal components are arranged in decreasing order of variance, so the first principal component accounts for as much variability in the data as possible, and each subsequent component accounts for the most remaining variability. The number of principal components used to represent the data can be determined by considering the cumulative proportion of variance explained by each component.

**Encoding:** 
Encoding is an important concept in data science and programming, as it enables data to be represented, stored, and processed in a way that is efficient, accurate, and consistent across different systems and applications.
For example, text data may need to be encoded in a specific format, such as ASCII or Unicode, to ensure that it can be read and displayed correctly across different devices and software programs. Similarly, numeric data may need to be encoded in a specific format, such as binary or hexadecimal, to enable efficient storage and manipulation.

Encoding can also refer to the process of representing categorical variables as numerical values, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. This is done by assigning unique numerical codes to each category, which allows the data to be processed by machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs.

**ResNet152v2**
The ResNet152 model architecture has been widely used in image recognition and classification tasks due to its superior performance compared to previous models. One key concept behind ResNet152 is the use of residual connections, which enable the model to efficiently learn deeper and more complex features. Unlike traditional models that simply stack layers on top of each other, ResNet152 adds residual connections that allow information to bypass a layer and be directly passed to the next. So the role of these connections is to perform identity function over the activation of shallower layer, which in-turn produces the same activation. This output is then added with the activation of the next layer. To enable these connections or essentially enable this addition operation, one need to ensure the same dimentions of convolutions through out the network, that's why resnets have same 3 by 3 convolutions throughout. This prevents the issue of vanishing gradients, where the gradients become too small and prevent the model from learning effectively. ResNet152 also uses global average pooling instead of fully connected layers, which reduces the risk of overfitting and makes the model more robust to different input sizes.To enable these residual connections, the convolutions used throughout the network must have the same dimensions. In other words, the convolutional layers should use the same kernel size and number of filters so that the outputs of each layer have the same dimensions. This ensures that the output of the residual connection can be added to the output of the next layer.

Compared to other models such as VGG19, ResNet152 has significantly fewer parameters while achieving higher accuracy. VGG19, for example, has 138 million parameters while ResNet152 has only 60 million. This makes ResNet152 more computationally efficient and faster to train. Additionally, ResNet152 is able to learn features at different levels of abstraction, which allows it to better capture the intricacies of images. VGG19, on the other hand, primarily focuses on capturing low-level features such as edges and textures. Overall, ResNet152 has proven to be a powerful and efficient model architecture that continues to be widely used in various image recognition tasks.

1. Introduction
CNNs have become popular due to their high performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, understanding how these models make their decisions is crucial for their application in real-world scenarios. The high dimensionality of CNNs makes it challenging to interpret them, leading to the need for new methods to facilitate this task. Concept Whitening PCA is a recent technique that has shown promise in improving CNN interpretation by mapping the original features to a new space.

2. Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks
CNNs are a type of deep neural network that have shown remarkable performance in image-related tasks. They consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers extract features from the input image, while the pooling layers downsample the features. The fully connected layers use these features to make the final prediction. The training process of a CNN involves adjusting the weights of the layers to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

3. Challenges in Interpreting CNNs
The high level of complexity of CNNs makes it challenging to interpret them. The features extracted by the convolutional layers are abstract and not directly related to the input image. Additionally, the high dimensionality of these features makes it difficult to visualize and understand how the model makes its decisions.

4. Concept Whitening PCA Method
The Concept Whitening PCA method is a recent technique that aims to make CNN interpretation easier by mapping the original features to a new space. This new space has a lower dimensionality and is characterized by uncorrelated features. The method involves two main steps: Concept Whitening and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

4.1 Concept Whitening
Concept Whitening is a technique that aims to minimize the correlation between the features extracted by the convolutional layers. The method involves subtracting the mean of each feature and normalizing it by dividing by its standard deviation. This step ensures that the features have zero mean and unit variance.

4.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a technique that aims to find a new set of uncorrelated features that capture the most significant variance in the data. The method involves computing the covariance matrix of the normalized features and finding its eigenvectors. The eigenvectors represent the principal components of the data, and their corresponding eigenvalues represent the amount of variance captured by each component. The new features are obtained by projecting the original features onto the eigenvectors.

5. Applying Concept Whitening PCA to CNNs
Applying the Concept Whitening PCA method to CNNs involves applying the Concept Whitening and PCA steps to the features extracted by the convolutional layers. The resulting features are then used to train a new model or visualize the decision-making process of the model. **The new features are easier to interpret, as they have a lower dimensionality and are uncorrelated**.

**The Concept Whitening PCA method can also be used to visualize the decision-making process of a CNN. By projecting the original features onto the new features obtained by the method, we can obtain a low-dimensional representation of the data. This representation can be visualized using techniques such as t-SNE or UMAP**.

6. Advantages and Limitations of Concept Whitening PCA
**The Concept Whitening PCA method has several advantages over other interpretation techniques. Firstly, it reduces the dimensionality of the features, making them easier to interpret. Secondly, it removes the correlation between the features, which can improve the performance of the model. Finally, it can be used to visualize the decision-making process of a CNN**.

However, the Concept Whitening PCA method also has some limitations. Firstly, it requires a significant amount of computational resources, as it involves computing the covariance matrix of the features. Secondly, it assumes that the features are normally distributed, which may not always be the case. Finally, it may not always provide a complete understanding of the decision-making process of a CNN.

7. Future Research Directions
Future research on the Concept Whitening PCA method could focus on improving its efficiency and addressing its limitations. One possible direction could be to explore alternative techniques for computing the covariance matrix, such as randomized methods. Another direction could be to investigate the use of non-parametric methods for modeling the distribution of the features.

8. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Concept Whitening PCA method is a promising technique for interpreting CNNs. By mapping the original features to a new space with lower dimensionality and uncorrelated features, the method makes it easier to interpret the decision-making process of a CNN. While the method has some limitations, it has several advantages over other interpretation techniques and has the potential to improve the performance of CNNs.
